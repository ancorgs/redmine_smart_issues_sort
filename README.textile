h2. Redmine smart issues sort plugin

Smart issues sort plugin is a Redmine plugin that replaces default sort with one more intellegent.
This sort method honors issue tree and parent - child relationships.

Also this plugin adds category support for queries and several parent sort options.

*IMPORTANT:* This is a fork of the original repository at https://github.com/logical-and/redmine_smart_issues_sort go there for the _official version_.

*EVEN MORE IMPORTANT:* In Redmine 2.4 query role visibility was introduced which required some adjustments in the query form. As a consequence, there are two branches in this repository. If you are using a version prior to Redmine 2.4, then use the _redmine2.3_ branch. If your version is 2.4 or higher, then use the _master_ branch.

h3. Smart sorting

Plugin replaces default Redmine issues sorting with one more intellegent. This type of sorting always puts children issues of parent issue after parent.

Also it eleminates inconvenience when root issues sorted by parent issue are sorted by their ids instead.

Because this kind of sorting has to sort all the issues in query it could be quite long compared to default for big (>3000 issues) queries.

Plugin solves following issues in Redmine: *#7907, #10048*

h3. New query options

* Plugin adds categories support for Redmine queries and displays queries grouped by categories.
* Plugin adds new option to queries which allows to always sort query by parent first thus keeping hierarchical issues structure

h3. Global plugin options

* *By default sort by parent issue first*
 Automatically sorts issues by parent issue first if not explicitly disabled in named query
* *Use default Redmine sort if no parent sort involved*
 Allows to fallback to default Redmine sorting if no parent sorting involved for speeding up query process
* *Put issues without values in sort fields on top (default Redmine behavior)*
 Puts issues with empty fields (ie Start Date or Due date) foremost, otherwise puts them in the end of the list
